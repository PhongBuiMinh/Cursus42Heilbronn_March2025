// A pipe end is only actually closed when ALL processes that have it open call close() on it.
// Reaping = the parent calling wait() or waitpid() to collect the childâ€™s exit status and remove it from the process table.
// Parent closing doesn't affect children, but it can destroy pipes if you close them before all children that need them are forked.
// Close in parent loop: Children are messy, but parent cleans up systematically
// Close in children: Children are clean from the start

// int fd = open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
// pathname: Path to the file
// flags: File access mode (e.g., O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_CREAT, etc.)
// mode: File permissions (used only when creating a file)
// The mode argument is only used when you include the O_CREAT flag

// char *cmd_path = "/bin/ls";  // âœ… Tells the system what to run
// char	*cmd_args[] = {"ls", "-l", NULL};  // âœ… Tells it how to run it (with what args)
// char *custom_envp[] = {  // âœ… Tells it where and under what conditions to run it
// 	"PATH=/custom/bin:/usr/bin", // finding executables

// The term key environment usually refers to the most important environment variables that influence how a program behaves when it's executed. These are the variables that define the system contextâ€”like where to find executables, how to format output, and what user or locale settings apply.
// ðŸ§  How It Works
// When a process (like your shell) launches another process (like ls), it passes its environment to the child.
// The child gets a copy of the environmentâ€”not a referenceâ€”so it can modify its own variables without affecting the parent.
